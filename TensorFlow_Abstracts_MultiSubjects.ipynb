    "# TensorFlow on Titles of Multiple Subjects from July 2017 Training Data \n",
    "In this notebook, a recurrent neural network is used to identify disciplines from journal titles. Using a RNN is useful and more accurate since information about the *sequence* of the words is used. For this project, a dataset of titles (features) and subjects (labels) from scientific papers is used for the RNN training. This RNN uses an *embedding layer* for a more efficient representation of the vocabulary. This new representation of words from the embedding layer is then passed to Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells, which adds recurrent connections to the newtork."
