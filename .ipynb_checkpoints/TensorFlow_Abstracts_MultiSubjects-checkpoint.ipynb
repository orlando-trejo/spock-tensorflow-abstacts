    "# TensorFlow on Abstracts of Multiple Subjects from August 2017 Training Data \n",
    "In this notebook, a recurrent neural network is used to identify disciplines from journal abstracts. Using a RNN is useful and more accurate since information about the *sequence* of the words is used. For this project, a dataset of titles (features) and subjects (labels) from scientific papers is used for the RNN training. This RNN uses an *embedding layer* for a more efficient representation of the vocabulary. This new representation of words from the embedding layer is then passed to Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells, which adds recurrent connections to the newtork."

We consider both models that use the Press-Schechter (PS) and Sheth-Tormen (ST) halo mass functions to calculate the abundances of dark matter halos. The Lyman-alpha luminosity functions at z < 4 are well reproduced with only <10% of the LBGs emitting Lyman-alpha lines with rest equivalent width greater than the limiting equivalent width of the narrow band surveys. However, the observed luminosity function at z > 5 can be reproduced only when we assume that nearly all LBGs are Lyman-alpha emitters. Thus it appears that 4 < z < 5 marks the epoch when a clear change occurs in the physical properties of the high redshift galaxies. As Lyman-alpha escape depends on dust and gas kinematics of the inter stellar medium (ISM), this could mean that on an average the ISM at z > 5 could be less dusty, more clumpy and having more complex velocity field. All of these will enable easier escape of the Lyman-alpha photons. At z > 5 the observed Lyman-alpha luminosity function are well reproduced with'"
